# Transfer Pricing
## Data analytics or anything relevant for transfer pricing related topics.

_Disclaimer: this is a repo to document data analytic work I think is beneficial but under-explored for transfer pricing work. Any examples/codes presented here used randomly generated data to simulate situations appropriate for illustration purpose only. No proprietary data of any kind is used here. Essentially, I collect my intellectual thoughts here on transfer pricing for the purposes of further learnig and discussions only._

### Current topics I am exploring include:

#### 1. Tax avoidance
* Evidance 
* Model
* Tax risk assessment

#### 2. Descriptive and deep dive analytics using CBCR data (one year) 
* cleanse
* describe
* deep dive
    - Simple regression
    - Random forest decision tree

#### 3. Comparing PowerBI vs Data Studio
